Welcome to HierarQcal's documentation!
======================================
**HierarQcal** is an Open-Source Python Package for Building Custom Quantum Circuits for Machine Learning. The package simplifies the process of creating general quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) by enabling an hierarchical design process. With HierarQcal, automatic generation of QCNN circuits is made easy, and it facilitates QCNN search space design for neural architecture search (NAS). The package includes primitives such as convolutions, pooling and dense layers that can be stacked together hierarchically to form complex QCNN circuit architectures. Visit the :doc:`getting_started` section for installation and basic usage.
